# About

This is a project based on [`JSMastery's Video`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ3bGvy0WAY) to build a mobile job search functionality.
I tweaked some components based on what I thought is right but mostly just coded along the video. 

Tweaked stuff: 
- Added an image wrapper so we don't need to do the checkImageURL everytime we fetch an image
- Created a dynamic fetch so we can reuse the useFetch in the search component
- Added default React JS query in the JobType tabs.

## ðŸš€ How to use

You can clone this one and create a .env file containing `EXPO_PUBLIC_RAPID_API_KEY=rapidapikeyhere`
I also added a basic prettierrc file to automatically format on save. 

Here are some screenshots of the finished app. Unfortunately, my free subscription on the jsearch is already spent.

Disclaimer: 
This is an unfinished app. Same scope with the codealong since I don't see a reason to finish this since I can't commit to subscribe to the JSearch API for now.

It was fun creating this and I will continue learning regarding authentication on the next app.
